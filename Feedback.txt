CHAPTER 4: Feedback

App Lab: Run and Hide is a fun game, kind of hard after a few tries because it speeds up. I found the design super simple and nice, but the X would jump out of the set boxes sometimes. Overall, I found it simple and fun. 

Play Lab: Cute game, not very hard. The movement works well but the game seems small. Not a lot of replay potential. Overall, it was fun, simple and worked well.
